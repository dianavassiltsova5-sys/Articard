<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack application for managing security shift reports for Articard Turvafirma. Starting from a basic React/FastAPI/MongoDB template, the engineer implemented core features like shift creation, viewing, and detailed incident management in Estonian. Key milestones included establishing a functional CRUD system, improving UI/UX with Shadcn UI components, optimizing PDF reports for printing, and incorporating detailed incident fields (G4S, ambulance, prevented theft, incident time). The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly in resolving date handling issues and ensuring correct data flow between frontend and backend. The latest work focuses on refining the visual presentation of incident details in reports, addressing specific user requests for color-coding and terminology.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create a web application in Estonian for Articard Turvafirma to track security guard work shifts and incidents.
**Core Functionality:**
1.  **Shift Management**: Record shifts with Wed Oct  8 00:49:07 UTC 2025,  (location), and .
2.  **Incident Management**:
    *   Attach  (general or theft) to shifts.
    *   **General Incident**: Requires a .
    *   **Theft Incident**: Requires  (male/female), ,  (erivahendid), and  (released, paid and left, handed to police).
    *   Ability to add/modify incidents after initial report saving.
    *   **Additional Fields**: ,  (checkboxes),  (checkbox for theft incidents with associated sum), and .
3.  **Reporting**:
    *   Shifts viewable on a calendar.
    *   PDF download for individual daily reports.
    *   Monthly report summary (total hours, incidents per day).
    *   PDF download for comprehensive monthly reports, including detailed incident descriptions, hours worked, and shift times.
4.  **User Interface (UI/UX)**:
    *   Modern, professional design fitting a security firm (e.g., logo, corporate colors).
    *   Responsive design for mobile viewing.
    *   PDF reports should be compact, fit on a single A4 page, and have a simplified print header.
    *   Incident details in reports should be clearly structured and readable.
    *   Specific visual enhancements: bold and color-coded text for  (red),  (green/red),  (red if called).
    *   Remove yellow/red circle indicators from objects in monthly report table.
    *   Update text varguste kahju to ennetatud varguse summa for prevented thefts.
5.  **CRUD Operations**: Implement functionality to delete shifts and reports.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a series of user requests focused on enhancing the visual presentation and accuracy of the monthly and detailed shift reports. Specifically, the user requested:
1.  **Color-coding and Styling**: Make  (amount) bold and red. Make  (outcome) bold green if отпустили (released) and bold red if в полицию передан (handed to police). Make G4S and ambulance indicators bold red if yes, otherwise normal. Apply a pleasant style to these.
2.  **Table Visuals**: Remove the yellow/red circle icon displayed next to objects in the  (monthly report) table.
3.  **Text Correction**: Change varguste kahju (theft damage) to ennetatud varguse summa (prevented theft amount) in the  table summary.

The AI engineer has begun implementing these changes, starting with  and . The last action was adding the requested color-coding and styling to  displays in  (Chat Message 497).
